# Simple-3D-JS-Graphics-Engine
A simple 3D graphics engine that runs in a browser.

This project was based on the One Lone Coder's "Code-It-Yourself! 3D Graphics Engine Part #1 - Triangles & Projection" from
https://youtu.be/ih20l3pJoeU. His code was written in C++, which I adapted to Javascript. It displays a cube made of triangles
onto the screen. This is a proof of concept done to learn Javascript, but it may expand in the future.

**HOW TO RUN**:
Download the HTML and Javascript file into the same folder, then open the HTML file.
